# Astropy Tutorials

This repository contains tutorials for the [Astropy](http://astropy.org)
project (also on [github](https://github.com/astropy/astropy)).

## Running Tutorials

The easiest way to get started quickly is to use binder to run the tutorials in
your web browser - when this loads, click the "tutorials" folder and you should
see all the tutorials:

    :target: http://mybinder.org/repo/astropy/astropy-tutorials/docs/tutorials

To run the tutorials *locally*, you need jupyter notebook installed::

    jupyter notebook

The tutorials are initially empty of any output.  You can run them by pressing
"Run All" under the "Cell" menu in the notebook file.

## Dependencies

See the conda environment file or pip requirements file for a list of
dependencies.
