Learn Astropy
=============

Learn Astropy consolidates:

* Astropy Tutorials
* Astropy Documentation
* Examples
* Guides

Learn Astropy makes all the Astropy content easily accessible through a single dynamically searchable web page. 
It organises the Astropy tutorials in a more efficient way and adds functionalities like filter by keywords, search for filters, make search queries in tutorials and documentation simultaneously.
It also redesigns the individual tutorials with a sidebar to ease navigation through the tutorials and gives the tutorials a more modern feel at the same time.
