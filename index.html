<p>The astropy tutorials have been moved to a new location <a href="http://tutorials.astropy.org">here</a>, and all new content is now posted there.  This page should auto redirect you to that page in 5 seconds.</p>

If you really wanted to see the old (unmaintained) version of the tutorials that was previously at this location, click <a href="prev_index.html">here</a>.
